#About The Book

As Embedded Linux systems become ubiquitous, powering countless devices in our daily lives, they’ve become prime targets for cyberattacks. Through this comprehensive guide to safeguarding your Linux devices, Matt St. Onge equips you with the knowledge and tools to mitigate the risks associated with hardware and software vulnerabilities.

This book starts by exploring the world of embedded systems, the brains behind your everyday appliances and takes you through the different types of embedded systems, their uses, and the platforms they run on, while addressing their unique security challenges and support considerations. You’ll learn to build a successful, secure, and user-friendly solution by exploring the critical hardware and software components that form the foundation of a secure appliance. We won't forget the human element; you'll learn how to configure your system to prevent user errors and maintain its integrity. The book lets you put your newfound knowledge into action, guiding you through designing a robust build chain that supports the entire lifecycle of your appliance solution, enabling seamless updates without your direct involvement.

By the end of this book, you’ll be equipped to adapt your appliance to the ever-evolving threat landscape, ensuring its continued security and functionality in real-world conditions.
